# Contributing to Snake Game

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project was developed as a university assignment, but any improvements, bug fixes, or new ideas are more than welcome to make this classic game even better.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create your branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-functionality`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add new functionality"`.
4. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/new-functionality`.
5. Open a **Pull Request**.

## Ideas for Contribution

- **New Game Modes:** Implement specialized levels, time trials, or "ghost" modes.
- **Visual Improvements:** Add animations for the snake's movement, better fruit textures, or custom background themes.
- **Difficulty Balancing:** Refine the speed increments and obstacle placement for a smoother learning curve.
- **Code Refactoring:** Improve the Object-Oriented structure or apply design patterns to make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Enhanced Physics:** Improve collision detection or add "power-ups" that change the snake's behavior.

## Development Tips

- **OOP Principles:** Since this is an educational project, try to keep your logic encapsulated within the relevant classes (`Snake`, `Fruit`, `Obstacle`).
- **Gamelib:** Familiarize yourself with how the `gamelib` handles the main loop and events before making deep changes to the rendering logic.
- **Clean Code:** Use descriptive variable names and keep the `src/` directory organized.

Thank you for your collaboration! 🎉
